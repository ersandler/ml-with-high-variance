# Machine Learning with High Variance
The code for my PEAK awards project on machine learning with high variance using Fantasy Premier League as a case study. The code primarily revolves around the case study, and while it is fairly interesting code in itself, context to this project can be found [on my website](https://elijahsandler.com/projects/ml-with-high-variance). 

The `.ipynb` depends on the  `.py` files, so please abstain from touching those unless you are sure of what you are doing. The `.py` files interact with data from the Premier League's API, which can be quite touchy. 

The `.ipynb` notebook contains several iterations of the solver, going from less to more complex as I add conditions in. The last one is the most accurate to the rules of FPL.
